## Basics

### 1. What is NestJS?

NestJS is a progressive Node.js framework built with TypeScript for building scalable and maintainable server-side applications. It follows modular architecture and uses **OOP + FP + FRP** concepts.

---

### 2. What are the main features of NestJS?

- Built-in **Dependency Injection**
- Modular architecture
- TypeScript support
- Supports **Express** & **Fastify**
- Middleware, Guards, Interceptors, Pipes
- Microservices support

---

### 3. How is NestJS different from Express.js?

- **Express** â†’ Minimal, unopinionated, requires manual structure.
- **NestJS** â†’ Opinionated, modular, comes with built-in DI, decorators, guards, interceptors.

---

### 4. Can you use NestJS with JavaScript?

Yes, NestJS supports JavaScript, but TypeScript is **recommended** for decorators, DI, and type safety.

---

### 5. What is the default HTTP provider in NestJS?

**Express** is the default, but you can switch to **Fastify** for better performance.

---

## Core Concepts

### 6. What are Controllers in NestJS?

Controllers handle incoming requests and return responses to the client. Example:

```ts
@Controller("users")
export class UsersController {
  @Get()
  findAll() {
    return ["User1", "User2"];
  }
}
```

---

### 7. What are Providers?

Providers are services, repositories, factories, helpers. They are **injectable** classes marked with `@Injectable()`.

---

### 8. What is a Module in NestJS?

A module is a class annotated with `@Module()`. It groups related components (controllers, services, providers). Example:

```ts
@Module({
  imports: [],
  controllers: [UsersController],
  providers: [UsersService],
})
export class UsersModule {}
```

---

### 9. What is Dependency Injection (DI) in NestJS?

DI allows classes to depend on **abstract contracts** instead of concrete implementations. Example:

```ts
constructor(private usersService: UsersService) {}
```

---

### 10. What is the purpose of `main.ts` in NestJS?

Itâ€™s the entry point where you bootstrap the application using `NestFactory.create()`.

---

## Modules & Dependency Injection

### 11. Difference between `@Global()` and normal modules?

- Normal module â†’ must import in each module where needed.
- `@Global()` â†’ providers become globally available (avoid overuse).

---

### 12. Can a provider be injected into multiple modules?

Yes. Export the provider from one module and import that module wherever needed.

---

### 13. What is `forwardRef()` in NestJS?

Used when two modules depend on each other (circular dependency).

```ts
imports: [forwardRef(() => UsersModule)];
```

---

### 14. How do you create a custom provider?

```ts
const CustomProvider = {
  provide: "APP_CONFIG",
  useValue: { apiKey: "12345" },
};
```

---

### 15. What is `useClass`, `useValue`, `useFactory` in providers?

- **useClass** â†’ provide a class
- **useValue** â†’ provide a constant value
- **useFactory** â†’ provide dynamically created value

---

## Controllers & Providers

### 16. What are route parameters in NestJS?

```ts
@Get(':id')
getUser(@Param('id') id: string) {
  return id;
}
```

---

### 17. How to pass query parameters?

```ts
@Get()
findAll(@Query('limit') limit: number) {}
```

---

### 18. How to inject services in controllers?

```ts
constructor(private readonly usersService: UsersService) {}
```

---

### 19. What is the difference between Singleton and Request Scoped providers?

- **Singleton** â†’ single instance for the whole app.
- **Request Scoped** â†’ new instance per request.

---

### 20. How to make a provider request-scoped?

```ts
@Injectable({ scope: Scope.REQUEST })
```

```

---

### 23. What are Guards in NestJS?

Guards decide whether a request is allowed to proceed to the route handler (e.g., AuthGuard).

---

### 24. What are Interceptors in NestJS?

Interceptors transform the request/response, add logging, caching, or modify data.

---

### 25. Difference between Middleware, Guard, Interceptor?

- **Middleware** â†’ before route handler
- **Guard** â†’ authorization logic
- **Interceptor** â†’ transform response/request

---
