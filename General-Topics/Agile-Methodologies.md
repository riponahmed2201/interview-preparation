# ðŸ§  100 Agile Methodology Interview Questions & Answers

## 1. What is Agile methodology?

**Answer:**
Agile is an iterative and incremental approach to software development that emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and customer satisfaction. It promotes adaptive planning, early delivery, and continuous improvement.

## 2. What are the key principles of Agile?

**Answer:**
The Agile Manifesto outlines 12 principles, including:

- Customer satisfaction through early and continuous delivery.
- Welcoming changing requirements, even late in development.
- Delivering working software frequently.
- Close, daily cooperation between business stakeholders and developers.
- Building projects around motivated individuals.
- Face-to-face conversation as the best form of communication.
- Working software as the primary measure of progress.
- Sustainable development pace.
- Continuous attention to technical excellence.
- Simplicityâ€”the art of maximizing the amount of work not done.
- Self-organizing teams.
- Regular reflection on how to become more effective.

## 3. What is the difference between Agile and Waterfall?

**Answer:**
Agile is iterative and flexible, allowing changes throughout the development process. Waterfall is a linear and sequential model, where each phase must be completed before the next begins, making it less adaptable to changes.

## 4. What are the different Agile methodologies?

**Answer:**
Some popular Agile methodologies include:

- Scrum
- Kanban
- Extreme Programming (XP)
- Feature-Driven Development (FDD)
- Dynamic Systems Development Method (DSDM)
- Lean Software Development

## 5. What is Scrum?

**Answer:**
Scrum is an Agile framework that divides development into fixed-length iterations called Sprints, typically lasting 2â€“4 weeks. It emphasizes roles like Scrum Master, Product Owner, and Development Team, and ceremonies such as Sprint Planning, Daily Standups, Sprint Review, and Sprint Retrospective.

## 6. What are the roles in Scrum?

**Answer:**
The three primary roles in Scrum are:

- **Product Owner:** Defines the product backlog and ensures the team delivers value.
- **Scrum Master:** Facilitates the Scrum process and removes impediments.
- **Development Team:** Self-organizing group that works to deliver the product increment.

## 7. What is a Sprint?

**Answer:**
A Sprint is a time-boxed iteration in Scrum, typically lasting 2â€“4 weeks, during which a potentially shippable product increment is created.

## 8. What is a Product Backlog?

**Answer:**
The Product Backlog is a prioritized list of features, enhancements, bug fixes, and technical work required for the product. It is continuously updated and maintained by the Product Owner.

## 9. What is a Sprint Backlog?

**Answer:**
The Sprint Backlog is a subset of the Product Backlog items selected for the Sprint, along with a plan for delivering the product increment and achieving the Sprint Goal.

## 10. What is a Burn Down Chart?

**Answer:**
A Burn Down Chart is a graphical representation of work left to do versus time. It shows the rate at which work is being completed and helps predict when all work will be completed.

## 11. What is a Burn Up Chart?

**Answer:**
A Burn Up Chart shows the amount of work completed and the total amount of work, helping to track progress and scope changes over time.

## 12. What is Velocity in Agile?

**Answer:**
Velocity is the amount of work a team completes during a Sprint, measured in story points or other units. It helps in forecasting future Sprints.

## 13. What is a User Story?

**Answer:**
A User Story is a short, simple description of a feature told from the perspective of the user or customer. It typically follows the format: "As a \[type of user], I want \[an action] so that \[a benefit]."

## 14. What is a Definition of Done (DoD)?

**Answer:**
The Definition of Done is a shared understanding among the team of what it means for work to be complete. It includes criteria like code review, testing, and documentation.

## 15. What is a Sprint Review?

**Answer:**
A Sprint Review is a meeting at the end of a Sprint where the team demonstrates the work completed and discusses what to work on next.

## 16. What is a Sprint Retrospective?

**Answer:**
A Sprint Retrospective is a meeting where the team reflects on the past Sprint to identify improvements for the next Sprint.

## 17. What is a Daily Standup?

**Answer:**
A Daily Standup is a short, time-boxed meeting where team members discuss what they did yesterday, what they will do today, and any obstacles they are facing.

## 18. What is the role of a Scrum Master?

**Answer:**
The Scrum Master facilitates the Scrum process, helps remove impediments, coaches the team, and ensures Scrum practices are followed.

## 19. What is the role of a Product Owner?

**Answer:**
The Product Owner defines the Product Backlog, prioritizes items, and ensures the team delivers value to the customer.

## 20. What is the role of the Development Team?

**Answer:**
The Development Team is responsible for delivering the product increment, self-organizing to complete the work, and collaborating with the Scrum Master and Product Owner.

## 21. What is the purpose of Sprint Planning?

**Answer:**
Sprint Planning is a meeting where the team discusses what work will be done during the Sprint and how it will be accomplished.

## 22. What is the purpose of a Sprint Goal?

**Answer:**
The Sprint Goal is a concise statement of what the team aims to achieve during the Sprint, providing focus and direction.

## 23. What is the purpose of a Sprint Backlog?

**Answer:**
The Sprint Backlog is a list of tasks to be completed during the Sprint, providing transparency and focus for the team.

## 24. What is the purpose of a Daily Standup?

**Answer:**
The Daily Standup promotes communication, identifies obstacles, and ensures alignment among team members.

## 25. What is the purpose of a Sprint Review?

**Answer:**
The Sprint Review allows stakeholders to inspect the product increment and provide feedback for future work.

## 26. What is the purpose of a Sprint Retrospective?

**Answer:**
The Sprint Retrospective provides an opportunity for the team to reflect on the Sprint and identify improvements for the next Sprint.

## 27. What is Kanban?

**Answer:**
Kanban is an Agile methodology that focuses on visualizing the flow of work, limiting work in progress, and continuously improving processes.

## 28. What is a Kanban Board?

**Answer:**
A Kanban Board is a visual tool used to manage work, typically divided into columns representing different stages of the workflow.

## 29. What is a Work In Progress (WIP) Limit?

**Answer:**
A WIP Limit is a constraint that limits the number of tasks that can be in progress at any given time, helping to identify bottlenecks and improve flow.

## 30. What is a Pull System?

**Answer:**
A Pull System is a workflow model where work is pulled into the process based on capacity, rather than pushed based on demand.

## 31. What is a Lead Time?

**Answer:**
Lead Time is the total time taken from when a task is requested until it is completed.

## 32. What is a Cycle Time?

**Answer:**
Cycle Time is the time taken to complete a task once work has started on it.

## 33. What is the difference between Lead Time and Cycle Time?

**Answer:**
Lead Time includes the time before work starts, while Cycle Time measures only the time spent actively working on the task.

## 34. What is a Cumulative Flow Diagram?

**Answer:**
A Cumulative Flow Diagram is a visual representation of the flow of work through different stages, helping to identify bottlenecks and inefficiencies.
